# School-District-Analysis

# Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to review school district results while working with Python/Jupter Notebook. 

# Results

Due to the inaccurate data, the analysis had to be re-worked. After removing the scores for 9th graders from Thomas High, there was a slight shift in the student count, average test scores and overall passing percentages.

# Summary/Insights:

Fortunately, even after the data removal- the results were slightly shifted. Since the change in the results were minimal, the inaccuracy of the data did not affect the overall school district numbers.
